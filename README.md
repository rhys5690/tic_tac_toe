This is a Tic Tac Toe game I created as a project at General Assembly.

I wanted to include perfect game logic which didn't allow people to change another player's X or O after it had been placed.

I also wanted to put a countdown timer and cover image which disappeared when the page finished loading.

I had trouble finding a way to overlay the cover image and countdown timer over the board and have it disappear when the game started.

Hope you enjoy the game!
